Trip Service Kata
=================

## Business Rules

Imagine a social networking website for travellers:
- You need to be logged in to see the content
- You need to be a friend to see someone else's trips
- If you are not logged in, the code throws an exception

## Exercise Constraints

- TripDAO and UserSession classes cannot be modified

## Problem to solve
- Change the second business rule to allow seeing someone else's trips also if you have friends in common
